            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>The Demon Slayer Corps is an organization dedicated to hunting and killing demons. Most members of the Demon Slayer Corps are combatants, known as Demon Slayers.</p>
            <p>As the Demon Slayer Corps isn't officially recognized by the government,its members are forced to work in secrecy, which means that Demon Slayers cannot openly carry their swords in public. The majority of people are unaware of the existence of demons, and even if Demon Slayers were to reveal the truth about their job, they would be met with skepticism and disbelief from most individuals. Allowing Demon Slayers to openly wield swords would only incite chaos and confusion among the general population. By maintaining a low profile and avoid drawing unnecessary attention, they can carry out their duties covertly and effectively.Nevertheless, whispers of the Demon Slayers have permeated public consciousness, existing as mere folklore in the minds of some. However, when civilians encounter demons or witness a Demon Slayer engaging a demon firsthand, they come face-to-face with the reality of their existence and the truth behind the tales they've heard.</p>
            <p>Without any support from the government or other sponsors, the Demon Slayer Corps relies solely on the resources provided by the Ubuyashiki family for its daily operations. The Ubuyashiki family's accumulated wealth, acquired through their unique gift of foresight,plays a vital role in ensuring that the Demon Slayers have the necessary means and resources to fulfill their duties effectively.</p>
